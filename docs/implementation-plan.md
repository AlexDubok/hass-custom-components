## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Home Assistant API changes | High | Low | Create abstraction layer for HA interactions |
| Chart library complexity | Medium | Medium | Start with simple charts, add features incrementally |
| Responsive design challenges | Medium | Medium | Test frequently on multiple device sizes |
| Schedule automation complexity | High | High | Research HA automation API thoroughly before implementation |

## Technical Considerations

### Weather Display
- Use Home Assistant's weather entity attributes for conditions, temperature, and forecasts
- Consider caching weather data to reduce API calls
- Implement appropriate error handling for missing weather entities

### History View
- Research Home Assistant's history API endpoints and authentication requirements
- Consider data aggregation strategies for efficient chart rendering
- Plan for handling large datasets with pagination or time-based filtering

### Scheduling Interface
- Research Home Assistant's automation API for creating and managing automations
- Design a clear and intuitive UI for schedule creation
- Implement validation to prevent invalid schedules

### Responsive Design
- Use CSS variables for consistent styling
- Implement media queries and flex/grid layouts for responsive behavior
- Test on various device sizes and orientations

### Testing
- Set up Jest for unit testing
- Consider using Storybook for component development and testing
- Implement mock services for testing components in isolation
